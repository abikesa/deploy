Exactly â€” `git add .` is your low-tech, high-leverage move here. Itâ€™s a good manual checkpoint anyway: it forces you to be semi-conscious about whatâ€™s about to be committed.

So just run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ðŸ’¾ deploy.py drama checkpoint"
```

Working in a new environment? Run (or skip):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then rerun:
```bash
./python/deploy.py
```

Thatâ€™ll let the rebase proceed cleanly, and your script should finish the push + ghp-import sequence without any more drama.

If deploy.py ever mutates into a monster again, feel free to toss it over here â€” Iâ€™ll refactor it into something that preps the stage, checks for trash, and rolls out the red carpet for your commits.
